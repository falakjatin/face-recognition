# Face Recognition with OpenCV, and Haar-Cascade Algorithm

This is my final year project of engineering. It might not work because its not maintained.

 ### ⚠️ Warning: Proceed with Caution!
 #### This code was crafted by a final-year engineering student running on caffeine, deadlines, and sheer determination. Expect miracles, chaos, and maybe a few bugs that could rewrite the laws of physics. Watch the code at your own risk! 😄
